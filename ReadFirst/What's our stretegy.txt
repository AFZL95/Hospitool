we have two type of strategy for designing a system in RTM version of VS:
1- Data First
2- Model First

we choose model first, because of we want to write a application with some tables that we created first. and work with them.
despite of Model first streategy, whitch is writing the code, and then creating the required database from it.

in EF model first stretegy we firstly create a new project and in the designer view of the VS we create the entities.
