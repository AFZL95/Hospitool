# Hospitool 

![alt text](https://github.com/AFZL95/Hospitool/blob/master/Ducuments/img/logo.png "Hospitool")

as the name says, it's Complete Hospital Management tools that facilitate the whole administrative and medical procedures simultaneously.


## Requirements:

1. One Computer!
2. MSSQL server (Complete or Elite version) for preserving and managing our DataBase
3.  MS Visual Studio (For editing or contributing :)) 

## Installation Stuff:
there is two kind of approach in my opinion actually.
first one is better and more straight forward. but if you prefer to start from the infrastructural level choose the second approach.

### First Approach (Easy Way):
go to your MSSQL management client and check everything is Okay.
restore the database backup that linked below:
```
Hospitool\DB Stuff\DataBase Backups\Hospitool.bak
```
done!
you can go to the next level!


### Second Approach (Geek way!):
First, you should create a database in MSSQL with the exact name of "Hospitool".
The second thing that you should do is you Browse the "Hospitool.sln" and find the "HospitoolDatabase.edmx" part in the solution Explorer area. open it. and in the main area right-click on the blank area and choose " like the figure shown below:

## Future Works:

Translating the whole project in English in the case of ability to eat this ugly frog!
